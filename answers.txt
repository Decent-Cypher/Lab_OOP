Question:
- Which classes are aggregates of other classes? Checking all constructors of whole classes if they initialize for their parts?

Answer:
    + Store aggregates Media through ArrayList<Media> itemsInStore.
    + Cart aggregates Media through ArrayList<Media> itemsOrdered.
    + CompactDisc aggregates Track through ArrayList<Track> tracks.

Question:
- When overriding the equals() method of the Object class, you will have to cast the Object parameter obj to the type of Object that you are dealing with. For example, in the Media class, you must cast the Object obj to a Media, and then check the equality of the two objects’ attributes as the above requirements (i.e. title for Media; title and length for Track). If the passing object is not an instance of Media, what happens?

Answer:
If the object obj is not an instance of Media, we should have a checking condition
if (obj == null || getClass() != obj.getClass())}
	return false;
}
Then we can cast the object to the Media type 

Question: 
Alternatively, to compare items in the cart, instead of using Comparator, we can use the
Comparable interface and override the compareTo()method. You can refer to the Java docs to see the
information of this interface.
Suppose we are taking this Comparable interface approach.
- What class should implement the Comparable interface?
- In those classes, how should you implement the compareTo()method be to reflect the ordering that we
want?
- Can we have two ordering rules of the item (by title then cost and by cost then title) if we use this
Comparable interface approach?
- Suppose the DVDs has a different ordering rule from the other media types, that is by title, then decreasing length, then cost. How would you modify your code to allow this?

Answer:
1. The Media class should implement the Comparable interface because it is the base class for all media . This way, all subclasses of Media can inherit the comparison logic.
2. We need to implement the compareTo() method in the Media class to reflect the ordering rules we want. We will also need to override compareTo() in the DVD class to apply a different ordering rule specific to each media type.
3. While the Comparable interface only allows for one natural ordering, we can handle multiple ordering rules by using Comparators, as shown here:
        public void sortByTitle() {
            Collections.sort(itemsOrdered, COMPARE_BY_TITLE_COST);
            System.out.println("Cart sorted by title.");
        }

        public void sortByCost() {
            Collections.sort(itemsOrdered, COMPARE_BY_COST_TITLE);
            System.out.println("Cart sorted by cost.");
        }
If we strictly use Comparable, we need to decide on one primary natural ordering.
4. We can modify like this
    @Override
    public int compare(Media m1, Media m2) {
        int costComparison = Float.compare(m2.getCost(), m1.getCost());
        if (costComparison != 0) {
            return costComparison;
        } else {
            return m1.getTitle().compareTo(m2.getTitle());
        }
    }
to
    @Override
    public int compare(DigitalVideoDisc dvd1, DigitalVideoDisc dvd2) {
        int titleComparison = dvd1.getTitle().compareTo(dvd2.getTitle());
        if (titleComparison != 0) {
            return titleComparison;
        }

        int lengthComparison = Integer.compare(dvd2.getLength(), dvd1.getLength());
        if (lengthComparison != 0) {
            return lengthComparison;
        }

        return Float.compare(dvd1.getCost(), dvd2.getCost());
    }
